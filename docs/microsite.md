# Microsite

If you don't wish to embed our tools on your own website, VoteAmerica can host a custom-labeled microsite for you.
The microsite is a standalone website that includes our full suite of voter tools, branded with your logo and colors.
You can see an example of a microsite at [demomicrosite.voteamerica.org](https://demomicrosite.voteamerica.org/).

## Getting started

Microsites are a paid add-on. Contact [sales@voteamerica.org](mailto:sales@voteamerica.org) to learn more.

## Customization options

You can customize the following elements to match your brand:

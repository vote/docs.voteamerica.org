VoteAmerica provides a handful of products for other organizations to use:

## [Embeddable software](embeds)

We offer a complete suite of embeddable tools that help citizens check their registration status, 
register to vote, request an absentee or mail-in ballot, find out where to vote, contact their local election office, and more.

The software is free to use and embed on your website. [Submit this form to create your free account](https://secure.voteamerica.org/signup/).

If you’d like access to the data that comes in via a dedicated 
instance of our embeddable software, you’ll need to sign up for a VoteAmerica+ account. 
Contact [sales@voteamerica.org](mailto:sales@voteamerica.org) for more information on VoteAmerica+ accounts.

## [Microsite](microsite)

If you don't wish to embed our tools on your own website, we can host a custom-labeled microsite for you.
The microsite is a standalone website that includes our full suite of voter tools, branded with your logo and colors.
VoteAmerica+ account required. Contact [sales@voteamerica.org](mailto:sales@voteamerica.org) to get started.

## [Civic Data API](api/index.md)

We maintain 80+ rigorously fact-checked data points per state, covering everything from voter ID laws to voter registration deadlines.

API access requires a VoteAmerica+ account. Contact [sales@voteamerica.org](mailto:sales@voteamerica.org) for more information.

## About VoteAmerica

VoteAmerica is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. VoteAmerica+ accounts are managed via VoteAmerica LLC, 
which is a wholly owned subsidiary of VoteAmerica. We do this for accounting purposes: everyone's life is just easier 
if software licensing is handled via a distinct legal entity.

# Easy links

Easy links are the fastest way to begin using VoteAmerica voter tools. You can begin sharing your custom links
right away, and activity driven through these links is automatically attributed to your account.

## Getting started

To start using easy links, sign up for a free VoteAmericaPlus account at [secure.voteamerica.org/signup/](https://secure.voteamerica.org/signup/).

Once you're logged in to your account, you can find your custom links at [secure.voteamerica.org/easy_links/](https://secure.voteamerica.org/easy-links/).
You'll also be able to see counts of the actions driven by your links in your dashboard.

If you'd like access to the information gathered via your links, you'll need to [upgrade to a paid account](https://secure.voteamerica.org/upgrade/).

## Customization options

You can customize the following options for your easy links:

- **URL ID** - By default, your easy link URLs will include a random number. You can replace this with a custom string 
  such as your organization name (for example: `voteamerica.org/l/YOUR_ORG_NAME/verify/`). Your chosen ID must:
  - Be composed of letters, numbers, hyphens, or underscores
  - Be unique across the VoteAmerica platform (i.e., not already in use by another organization)
- **Logo** - By default, your easy link pages will feature your organization name at the top of the page. You can upload a logo 
  to be displayed instead. Your logo file must be a PNG or JPG image of no more than 5MB in size.

Apply these customizations from the [company settings page](https://secure.voteamerica.org/settings/).

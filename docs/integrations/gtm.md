# Firing events in Google Tag Manager

[Google Tag Manager (GTM)](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/tag-manager/) is a system from Google that allows you to manage website tags. If you have GTM installed on your website, you can send the VoteAmerica+ events to GTM using the following JavaScript snippet.

```js
window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
window.addEventListener("VoteAmericaEvent", function (evt) {
  dataLayer.push(evt.detail.data);
});
```

Once the events are sent to GTM, you'll need to set up triggers for your tags there. [Google has documentation on that here.](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6106716?hl=en)

See [JavaScript Events](../../software/events) for more details on the types of events and the data contained in each event.

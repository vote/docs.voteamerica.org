# EveryAction

When a user makes use of a VoteAmerica+ software embed, we collect their contact information.  This can be
passed to [EveryAction](https://learn.bonterratech.com/everyaction.html) to add the person to your lists and campaigns.
You can also:
* specify an activist code that should be applied to users pushed by VoteAmerica+ tools.
* arrange for VoteAmerica+ UTM parameters to populate custom fields you create in EveryAction.

## Enabling

Enabling a sync from VoteAmerica to your EveryAction instance requires an approval from the EveryAction team.
Contact us at [sales@voteamerica.org](mailto:sales@voteamerica.org) to begin this process.

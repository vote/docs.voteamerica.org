# CTA PAD / Hopper

VoteAmericaPlus customers who are interested in connecting their VoteAmericaPlus data to another tool can do so 
via [Hopper by Community Tech Alliance](https://communitytechalliance.org/hopper). Current data destinations
include BigQuery, Redshift, and VAN, and CTA is working to develop more "hops". This is a paid service that
requires a business agreement with CTA.

## Enable Hopper integration

If you want to sync your VoteAmericaPlus data to CTA PAD / Hopper, email [info@techallies.org](mailto:info@techallies.org)
or submit a request via the [Community Tech Alliance website](https://communitytechalliance.org/get-hopping).

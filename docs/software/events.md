# JavaScript events
{: .no_toc }

VoteAmerica+ uses JavaScript event tracking, and we pass these events up to the parent window of embeds.

These events can be consumed by the parent window with a bit of JavaScript. These events have a type of `VoteAmericaEvent` and can be listened for using the following JavaScript snippet.

```js
window.addEventListener('VoteAmericaEvent', function(evt) {
  console.log(evt); // This can be replaced with any function
});
```

## VoteAmerica+ Events
{: .no_toc }

Here's a list of events provided by VoteAmerica+ tools and their detailed data. You can find this data by accessing the `detail.data` property within the event.

Some events have variable parameters, such as a state or url. Those variable parameters are denoted with square brackets, such as `[STATE]`.

### Absentee Tool

#### action-start event

Fired when the user submits the Absentee tool intake form.

```json-doc
{
  event: "action-start",
  tool: "absentee",
  state: "[STATE]",
  first_name: "[FIRST NAME]",
  last_name: "[LAST NAME]",
  email: "[EMAIL]",
  zipcode: "[ZIP CODE]"
}
```

#### action-finish event

Fired when the user has reached an end point in the Absentee workflow. 

```json-doc
{
  event: "action-finish",
  method: "[METHOD]", // see below for possible options
  tool: "absentee",
  url: "[EXTERNAL LINK]", // only included on events where the user was directed to an external site 
  state: "[STATE]",
  first_name: "[FIRST NAME]",
  last_name: "[LAST NAME]",
  email: "[EMAIL]",
  zipcode: "[ZIP CODE]"
}
```

The `method` property will provide more details about what took place. Possible `method` options include:
* `external` - The user clicked a link to visit a state-hosted online ballot request website (not available in all states).
* `pdf` - The user received an email with a PDF ballot request form they can print and mail.
* `ineligible-state` - The user was told that online and PDF options are not available in their state. They were provided details for contacting their local election office (applies to Mississippi).

* `redirect-to-register`- The user lives in a universal vote-by-mail state (they will automatically receive a ballot in the mail) and were asked whether they needed to update their address permanently or request a one-time ballot. They indicated they needed to update their address permanently and were redirected to the Register tool. (In this situation, an `action-start` event will be fired on the Register action simultaneously.)

#### action-follow-up event

Fired when the user returns to the Absentee flow and takes another action after an `action-finish` has occurred
(ex: Confirming that they successfully requested a ballot on a state website).

  url: "[EXTERNAL LINK]", // only included on events where the user was directed to an external site 
  state: "[STATE]",

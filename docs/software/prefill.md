# Form prefilling

You can prefill VoteAmerica+ software by using URL parameters. For embeds, certain URL parameters added to the parent window can be passed to the embedded tool.

The list of accepted parameters can be viewed here:

```
/* Form fields */
first_name
last_name
address1
address2
city
state
zipcode
month_of_birth
day_of_birth
year_of_birth
email
phone

/* Hidden source fields */
source
utm_campaign
utm_source
utm_medium
utm_term
utm_content
```

Some notes on using these URL parameters: 
* Any spaces in values should be replaced by `%20`. (Ex: `address1=123%20Main%20Street`)
* State should be passed as a 2-letter postal code (Ex: `state=CA`)
* Month of birth should be passed as a 2-digit number (Ex: `month=01` for January)

Example URL:
```
https://demo.voteamerica.org/verify-demo?first_name=Joe&last_name=Biden&address1=1600%20Pennsylvania%20Avenue%20Southeast&city=Washington&state=DC&zipcode=20003&month_of_birth=11&day_of_birth=20&year_of_birth=1942&email=joe@whitehouse.gov
```

# Data dictionary: Hopper sync

This document contains the column names and descriptions for data synced from VoteAmerica+ to 
[Hopper by Community Tech Alliance](https://communitytechalliance.org/hopper). 

The Hopper team can work with you to transform this data into a format that suits your destination tool. 
[Learn more here about the Hopper sync](/integrations/hopper/). 

Data for all VoteAmerica+ tools are pushed to Hopper as part of a unified schema. 
Because different tools collect different information, 
some columns will have NULL values for tools where they do not apply.
The table below includes a column to indicate which VoteAmerica+ tools collect the data.
